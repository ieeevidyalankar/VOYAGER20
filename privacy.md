# Types of data we process and for what purposes

When you visit our websites or our app, we collect some visitor statistics. The visitor statistics include information about the browser and operating system the visitor uses. That is all.

This information is collected solely for statistical purpose and is not used to identify individuals. These statistics help us prioritize our resources, since this site is hosted on free services with limited bandwidth (Github and Vercel). The legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest we have in providing you with a good experience when visiting the websites.
